# ES6 Data Manipulation 📊

Welcome to the **ES6 Data Manipulation** project! 🚀 This repository focuses on leveraging modern JavaScript features to manipulate and process data effectively. 💻


## Requirements ✅

- Node.js 12+ 🟢
- ESLint for code linting and style consistency. 🧹


## Tasks 📝

### 0. Basic list of objects ✅
Create a function `getListStudents` that returns an array of objects. Each object contains three attributes: `id` (Number), `firstName` (String), and `location` (String).

---

### 1. More mapping ✅
Create a function `getListStudentIds` that returns an array of IDs from a list of objects. If the input is not an array, return an empty array.

---

### 2. Filter ✅
Create a function `getStudentsByLocation` that returns an array of objects filtered by a specific city.

---

### 3. Reduce ✅
Create a function `getStudentIdsSum` that returns the sum of all student IDs using the `reduce` method.

---

### 4. Combine ✅
Create a function `updateStudentGradeByCity` that updates the grades of students in a specific city. If a student does not have a grade, assign `N/A`.

---

### 5. Typed Arrays ✅
Create a function `createInt8TypedArray` that returns a new `ArrayBuffer` with an `Int8` value at a specific position. If the position is invalid, throw an error.

---

### 6. Set data structure ✅
Create a function `setFromArray` that converts an array into a `Set`.

---

### 7. More set data structure ✅
Create a function `hasValuesFromArray` that checks if all elements in an array exist within a `Set`.

---

### 8. Clean set ✅
Create a function `cleanSet` that returns a string of all `Set` values starting with a specific string, separated by `-`.

---

### 9. Map data structure ✅
Create a function `groceriesList` that returns a `Map` of grocery items and their quantities.

---

### 10. More map data structure ✅
Create a function `updateUniqueItems` that updates the quantity of items in a `Map` with an initial quantity of `1` to `100`. If the input is not a `Map`, throw an error.
